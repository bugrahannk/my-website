# Prompt Guidance (Guidanca Scale)

The Promt Guidance parameter controls how closely Stable Diffusion will follow your prompt when rendering images. A higher value will force the AI to be more rigid and follow the prompt closely, while a lower value will give the AI more creative freedom.

Be careful when using extremely high values, such as 16-30. This can sometimes cause the image to "frying" and other artifacts. On the other hand, extremely low values like 0-4 will result in almost no compliance with the request.
