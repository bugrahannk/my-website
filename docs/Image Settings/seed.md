# Seed

The seed parameter is responsible for generating the initial noise used to render the image.

Different seeds will produce different images, but using the same seed will always produce the same image, even if you run the rendering process multiple times.

By using a fixed seed you can compare different models or parameters and observe their effect on the generated images. This allows for more precise and controlled experiments, providing valuable insight into the rendering process.
