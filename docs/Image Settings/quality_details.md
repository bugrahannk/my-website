# Quality & Details (Steps)

The Steps parameter controls the number of noise removal iterations that Stable Diffusion will perform. The more steps, the better the result will be, but only up to a certain point. In most cases, images will converge at 30 steps and will not change significantly at higher steps.

The number of steps directly affects production speed and cost.
