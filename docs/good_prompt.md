# How to Write Good Prompt

Explaining in detail what you want to produce will help you achieve the desired result. For better results, be specific and use descriptive language. For example, instead of writing "a landscape", you could write "a river flowing from a high place with misty mountains in the background, storm clouds, chaotic weather".
