# Generate Image/Design

When you select any category from the left side of the Dashboard, you will see a screen as shown in the gif.

<img src="https://stock-image.s3.amazonaws.com/guideimages/gif1.gif"/>

**1.** Type the image/design you want to get in the prompt field. Try the Suprise Me button above the prompt field for inspiration.

**2.** Optionally choose different models (Disney Model, Real Photo Model, Disco Difussion Model etc.)

**3.** Choose the direction of the image (Verical, horizontal, square)

**4.** Optionally set the Quality&Details and Prompt Guidance values. (If you are not familiar with this, use the default values in the dashboard.) See [Guidance Scale](../Image%20Settings/prompt_guidance) for more details on these settings.

**5.** Type the parts/errors you don't want in the image you want to produce in the Negative prompt section.

**6.** Shortly after hitting the Generate button, your image will be ready.
